## Synopsis

Roughly 10 hour project for fun. Wordoji creates user typed words with user selected emojis for the background and letters. For Example: the title Wordoji is created using the 💯 emoji for the background and the 🎱 emoji for creating the letters.

## Code Example

Each letter and symbol is represented in characters.js. When a user types the corresponding character object is called and translated into the selected emojis.

`A: [  
XXXXX,  
XZZZX,  
ZXXXZ,  
ZZZZZ,  
ZXXXZ,  
ZXXXZ,  
XXXXX  
    ]`

## Motivation

I would sometimes hand make these for fun in slack when we had an upcoming event, takes forever! Now its quick and easy. Speaking of slack, it can also accept slack's emoji format like :partyparrot:.
